# One Time Chat

## What is One Time Chat?

One Time Chat is a messaging application for Android devices. One of the core concepts of the app is that any text message you send, by default, is made available to the receiver only for a short time
before it becomes inaccessible. 

## How does it work?

* First, **register** an account.

* Then, use the newly created account to **log in**.

* **Add** new friends.

* **Send** and **receive** messages.
